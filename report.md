# Analysis of Randomized Quicksort and Hashing with Chaining

## Introduction
This assignment analyzes the performance and scalability of two fundamental algorithmic techniques: Randomized Quicksort and Hashing with Chaining. The goal is to understand how algorithm design choices affect efficiency under different input conditions. Both theoretical analysis and empirical experiments are used to evaluate performance and identify scenarios where certain algorithms perform better or worse.
## Randomized Quicksort Overview
Randomized Quicksort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by selecting a pivot element at random and partitioning the array into elements smaller than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot. The algorithm then recursively sorts the resulting subarrays. Randomization helps avoid consistently poor pivot choices, which can cause significant performance degradation in deterministic versions of quicksort.
## Average-Case Performance of Randomized Quicksort
Randomized Quicksort has an expected time complexity of O(n log n). This efficiency comes from the random selection of the pivot, which makes it unlikely that the algorithm will repeatedly produce extremely unbalanced partitions. On average, the array is split into reasonably balanced subarrays at each recursive step, reducing the total amount of work needed to sort the data. As a result, the overall number of comparisons grows proportionally to n log n rather than n squared.
## Empirical Comparison with Deterministic Quicksort
To evaluate practical performance differences, randomized quicksort was compared with deterministic quicksort that always selects the first element as the pivot. Experiments were conducted on randomly generated arrays and already sorted arrays of varying sizes. For random input, both algorithms performed similarly, with deterministic quicksort occasionally appearing slightly faster due to lower overhead. However, for sorted input, deterministic quicksort showed significantly worse performance as input size increased and even resulted in a recursion depth error for larger inp
## Hashing with Chaining Overview
Hashing with chaining is a technique used to implement efficient dictionary-like data structures. A hash function maps each key to an index in a hash table. When multiple keys map to the same index, a collision occurs. Chaining resolves collisions by storing all key-value pairs that hash to the same index in a linked list or bucket at that position. This approach allows the hash table to handle collisions while still supporting efficient insert, search, and delete operations.
